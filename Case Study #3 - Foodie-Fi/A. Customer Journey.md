### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT
	S.customer_id, P.plan_name, P.price, S.start_date
FROM Subscriptions AS S
JOIN Plans AS P ON P.plan_id = S.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8);
```

Output:
