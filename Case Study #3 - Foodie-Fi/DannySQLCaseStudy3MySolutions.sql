     customers to the overall revenue.
*/
-- 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
/*
**Answer:**

The key areas to understand the customer retention are the following ones:

1. Plan Changes:
   - Understand the specific triggers that lead the customers to changes their plans. This could involve 
     analyzing the benefits they seek, such as unlimited streaming or offline access. Additionally, explore 
     whether promotional offers or plan-specific features influences plan changes.
   - Implement an exit survey strategy for users who either downgrade or cancel their plans. Collecting feedback 
     directly from users can uncover nuanced insights into their decision making process.

2. Customer Support:
   - We can identify the common queries, concerns, or issues faced by customers from the customer support 
     interactions. Additionally track how effectively customer issues are resolved over time. This helps us 
	 understand if the customers are unhappy with the resolutions and our services, thereby leading them to churn out.

3. Content Preferences:
   - Explore not only what customers are looking for but also gather insights into why certain content might 
     not meet their expectations. Are there any programs that are not in the video library because of which 
	 customers are looking for? Conducting surveys of feedback sessions helps to understand specific content 
     preferences and expectations.

4. Platform Comparison:
   - Consider comparing Foodie-Fi with other platforms. Identify features, shows that competitors offer and 
     where Foodie-Fi might lack. This competitive analysis can reveal opportunities for improvement. Additionally 
	 assess user perceptions of Foodie-Fi to competitors through surveys or reviews.

5. Personalized Recommendations:
   - Understand how personalized recommendation can positively impact retention. Analyze successful cases where 
     tailored content suggestions lead to increased engagement. Implement ML algorithms to enhance recommendation 
     precision, ensuring users receive content aligned with their preferences.
   - Implement a feedback mechanism for users to provide explicit feedback on recommended content. This can 
     refine algorithms and enhance the accuracy of personalized suggestions.
